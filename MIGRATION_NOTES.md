# Mobile-First Migration Notes

## Overview
This migration adds mobile-first responsive design to our existing desktop application, ensuring a consistent experience across all devices while preserving the current desktop layout.

## Breakpoint Strategy
We follow a mobile-first approach with the following breakpoints:
- `xs`: 480px (Extra small devices)
- `sm`: 640px (Small tablets)
- `md`: 768px (Tablets)
- `lg`: 1024px (Laptops/Desktops)
- `xl`: 1280px (Large screens)

All styles default to mobile view (≤ 480px) with progressive enhancement via `@media (min-width: ...)` queries.

## Key Components
1. **Drawer Component**
   - Accessible slide-in navigation for mobile
   - ARIA compliant with role="dialog"
   - Focus trap and keyboard navigation
   - Closes on outside click/ESC

2. **Mobile Navigation**
   - Hamburger menu visible ≤ 768px
   - Uses Drawer component for navigation
   - Preserves desktop navigation ≥ 1024px

3. **Utility Hooks**
   - `useSwipe`: Touch gesture detection
   - `useFocusTrap`: Accessibility focus management

## Performance Optimizations
- GPU-accelerated animations via transform
- Conditional rendering for mobile-specific components
- No additional bundle size from external libraries
