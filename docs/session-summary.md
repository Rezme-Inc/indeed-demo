# Rezme Web App - Session Summary

## What We Did

1. **Project Initialization**

   - Created a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
   - Set up a modern folder structure using the `/src` directory.

2. **Supabase Integration**

   - Installed and configured Supabase for authentication and database.
   - Created tables for `user_profiles`, `hr_admin_profiles`, and `rezme_admin_profiles` in Supabase.
   - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) and policies for secure access.
   - Added indexes for performance.

3. **Environment Setup**

   - Added `.env.local` for Supabase credentials.
   - Updated `tailwind.config.js` and `globals.css` for Tailwind CSS.

4. **App Features**

   - Landing page with role selection (User, HR Admin, Rezme Admin).
   - Signup flow for each role, storing profile data in Supabase.
   - Dashboard pages for each role:
     - **User:** View own profile.
     - **HR Admin:** View connected users and visible users.
     - **Rezme Admin:** View all users and HR admins.
   - Added login buttons for each role on the landing page.

5. **Troubleshooting**

   - Fixed issues with dependency versions, Next.js config, and Tailwind setup.
   - Ensured the app runs and displays the landing page.

6. **Restorative Record System Refactoring** (Major Update)
   - **Refactored massive 2,349-line file** into modular components
   - **Achieved 74% code reduction** in main file (now 602 lines)
   - **Created organized structure**:
     - 10 section components (Introduction, Awards, Skills, etc.)
     - Reusable UI components (DatePicker, FileUpload, FormDialog, RecordItem)
     - Custom `useFormCRUD` hook for consistent CRUD operations
     - Centralized `saveToSupabase` utility (522 lines)
   - **Benefits achieved**:
     - Much better maintainability and readability
     - Each section can be worked on independently
     - Easier to test and debug
     - Better separation of concerns
     - No changes to functionality or UI - everything works exactly the same!
   - **Updated documentation** to reflect new architecture

## Next Steps

- Add logout functionality and profile editing.
- Expand the wizard for user onboarding.
- Add unit tests for the new modular components.
- Implement code splitting for better performance.
- Add more documentation and code comments.
- Prepare for AWS migration if needed.
